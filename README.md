# bigfile

Have you ever wanted to overwrite deleted file(s) and their metadata so that they can't be undeleted? Well, then this program might be the solution for you.

This program creates one big file and keeps writing to it until you run out of disk space or reach the maximum file size. Then it deletes this temporary file, so you get your disk space back.

This way, you can overwrite old file data and break any attempt to undelete them.

Note:

 This is a poor man's attempt to make a file shredder. It should not be used in any production or anything serious.
